Inconsistent operand order for logarithm to base x|"- Behavior of logarithm to base xThe first operand entered (or previous result) is the base, the second operator is the anti-logarithm (i.e. the number of which the logarithm is calculated).e.g.: '16   base log   2' yields 0.25 instead of the expected value 4.- Behavior of similar operatorsFor exponentiation (x<sup>y</sup>) the first operand is the base and the second operand is the exponent.For the n-th root (x<sup>1/y</sup>) the first operand is the radicand and the second operand is the index.The behavior of the logarithm (log<sub>x</sub>(y)) is inconsistent to similar binary operators and also to the GUI, which shows log<sub>y</sub>(x). Furthermore this behavior does not allow to take the logarithm to base x of a previous result."|open|851|undefined|[{"id":1243467235,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQzNDY3MjM1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/calculator/labels/triage%20needed","name":"triage needed","color":"e99695","default":false,"description":""}]|null

Missing Frame.NavigationFailed event|"I was trying to use your activation code as a way to check that I'm handling multi-view activation correctly in my own app. I notice that you check the return value of Frame.Navigate and throw if false.

Enable code analysis on all projects and resolve warnings|"Visual Studio's code analysis tools can help find issues in our C++ code. Eventually, it would be great to have these tools running in all of our builds and to fix all the warnings they generate.See #689 for an example of how to enable the tools during the build. We'll enable code analysis only in the 'Release' configuration to avoid slowing down Debug builds.To see which warnings still need to be fixed, check [a recent build from the master branch](https://dev.azure.com/ms/calculator/_build?definitionId=57&_a=summary&repositoryFilter=40&branchFilter=877).It would be best to submit fixes for unrelated warnings as separate PRs.

Support for significant figures|"<!--See https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator/blob/master/docs/NewFeatureProcess.md for suggestions on how to write a good feature pitch. Just want to submit an idea quickly? Try Feedback Hub instead: https://insider.windows.com/en-us/fb/?contextid=130-->**Problem Statement**[Significant figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significant_figures) (also called significant digits) are an important part of scientific and mathematical calculations and deals with the accuracy and precision of numbers. It is important to estimate uncertainty in the final result, and this is where significant figures become very important. (from [Wikibooks Chemical Engineering](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Chemical_Engineering_Processes/Significant_figures)) They're typically used from high school science to college classes these days and are used often in engineering settings. It is also part of a common core standard as per <http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSN/Q/> (a.k.a. HSN-Q.A.3), so it is arguably notable enough to support.**Evidence or User Insights**<!--Why should we do this?

AlwaysOnTop should use the same control than the normal mode to display calculation results.|"### Describe the issueInstead of using the same control than in Normal mode to display the current value, AOT use a different control based on `OverflowText`. This control wasn't made for this purpose, we should use the same control in both modes (cleaner, providing more features and easier to support). Originally, the Calculator had 2 similar controls:- **CalculationResult**    - Purpose: Display a numeric value or an error message    - Usage: Display the result of a calculation or the current value entered    - Unique features: Support auto font resizing, made to host a textblock, support left/right keys to scroll, support error messages, including change the font to correctly display the message, support LtR for error messages, support context menu (copy/paste the value)    - The control scrolls automatically to the end when the value changed (to replicate this behavior, `OverflowText` modified the VM and misuse `TokenUpdated` )- **OverflowText**    - Purpose: Display a ItemsControl    - Usage: Display the current operation (e.g.: `123 + 243 x 343`)    - Unique features: improve the accessibility of the containing ItemsControl.It is very clear when we compare the 2 controls that the first one corresponds exactly to our needs unlike the second. The current implementation tries to adjust/tweak the style of OverflowText to look like CalculationResult, instead we should use it directly.### How will we improve the code quality and the UX?Using the CalculationResult will effortlessly add the following features to AOT: - better sizing of the text, the current implementation (via visual states in Calculator.xaml) only uses 2 font sizes, a large and a very small one (see screenshots)- support of Left/Right keys- better display of error messages (a comment from this repository mentions that we should improve this point in AOT mode, switching to CalculationResult will solve the problem)- Support copy/paste via context menu.- All future enhancements to the normal view will be added automatically in AOT mode.- We will be able to improve the display of the operation without impacting AOT mode.- slightly better performance, only 1 control instead of 2 will be used to display results- remove huge template from Calculator.xaml, making the code easier to read.- improve transition between the 2 mode, a text selected in one mode will still be selected in the other.### Screenshots<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1226538/63923094-cbd12880-c9fa-11e9-9112-3215d7eec9e1.png' height='240' />The current implementation supports only 2 font sizes, not adapted to all the sizes supported by AOT<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1226538/63923440-6c274d00-c9fb-11e9-9bf0-9493541b8628.png' height='240' />The display of error messages can be improved### What do we need to do?-  Add the `ScrollButtonsPlacement='Above'` mode added by #647 in OverflowTextBlock to CalculationResult. (will it be necessary if the control auto-resizes the font?)- Remove `AlwaysOnTopStyleS`, `AlwaysOnTopStyleM` and `AlwaysOnTopResults` from `Calculator.xaml`- in visual states associated to AOT, set the correct values for `Result.MinFontSize`, `Result.MaxFontSize` to perfectly fit the AOT UI.### Device and Application Information - OS Build: 10.0.18875.0 - Architecture: X64 - Application Version: 10.1905.30.0 - Region: en-US - Dev Version Installed: True### Requested AssignmentIf possible, I would like to fix this."|open|648|undefined|[{"id":1355573903,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzU1NTczOTAz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/calculator/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"bfe5bf","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1273734578,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNzM0NTc4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/calculator/labels/codebase%20quality","name":"codebase quality","color":"E6B33D","default":false,"description":"Issues that are not bugs, but still might be worth improving (eg, code hygiene or maintainability)"}]|null

Enable free-form input of math expressions|"**Problem Statement**Today, when you input an expression, you are committing previous input with each operator, which means that you cannot easily edit or undo what you have already committed. We also have a key mapping such that keyboard keys are mapped to specific button inputs. This means that to enter 'cos()', you actually press o. This is unintuitive and makes entering equations difficult.We also currently only support linear input, which means we display this:x ^ 2 + √(2x)instead of this:![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1414423/62503564-92b1e980-b7a9-11e9-8f73-7933cf7ead89.png)**Evidence or User Insights**Our current keyboard mapping is unintuitive and requires extensive documentation to educate users (#157). Not only is free-form input more intuitive, there have been several issues opened that would require support for it as a pre-requisite (e.g., #163, #519, #150).**Proposal**Enable free-form input across calculator modes, which means that users can place the cursor anywhere inside of an equation input box to edit the expression. This also means that users can type or paste in 'cos(x)', which feels natural, as this is how you would write this expression up on a whiteboard.> Note: This is the same input behavior that we are going to have in graphing mode.**Goals*** Users can input their equations with free-form input* Expressions are displayed in rich [MathML](https://www.w3.org/Math/) styling format**Non-Goals*** Build a parser (this is covered by #526, which is a prerequisite for this work)* Introduce new input methods other than keyboard (e.g., inking input is covered by #24)**Low-Fidelity Concept**![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1414423/62503564-92b1e980-b7a9-11e9-8f73-7933cf7ead89.png)<sub>Just an example of rendering as MathML</sub>**Requested Assignment**I'm just suggesting this idea.

Collapse unit converters into single page and refresh layout|"**Problem Statement**Today, we treat each converter type as a high-level navigation item. This means that if you want to switch between volume and weight converters, you need to navigate to an entirely different page. While we do offer shortcuts to switch between modes, they are not very discoverable (#157), and parsing a mixed list of calculators and converters is unnecessarily more complex than it needs to be. Furthermore, the converter page interface is laid out differently than other calculator modes and feedback suggests that the interface could be made more intuitive.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1414423/61490296-787eab80-a961-11e9-9d8a-f8cdb3101958.png)**Evidence or User Insights**We currently have a flat navigation structure. According to [app navigation guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/basics/navigation-basics), this structure is appropriate when there are less than 8 pages in the group. We already have 13 converters, and #515 is looking at evaluating which converters and units we include, and suggests we may actually be _missing_ some converter types (increase to 17). In this case, hierarchical or an alternative navigation would be preferred.Some other UX issues have been identified as well. It is unclear how to quickly switch units (#172 and #266). There is some additional conversation in #382 and #379 as well.**Proposal**Collapse converters into a single 'Converter' page where you can select the type of conversion in addition to the units. There may be an opportunity to streamline input even further with #589 to allow users to input any unit they like without having to explicitly select a converter type first.**Goals*** Collapse top-level converter navigation into a single Converter (open question: does currency converter feel different enough to remain separate?)* Redesign page layout for greater consistency with other calculator modes* Redesign value input to align with other converter patterns (e.g., found in translation apps)**Non-Goals*** Determining which converters/units to include is out-of-scope (covered by #515)**Low-Fidelity Concept**![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1414423/61490046-e1195880-a960-11e9-9a7a-3952a74712b6.png)Bing Translator/Converter UX (for inspiration)![bing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1414423/54236480-d93c3a00-44d0-11e9-9bdd-11c0d0dc0616.jpg)![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1414423/61490237-538a3880-a961-11e9-86af-7571233bf54f.png)**Requested Assignment**I'm just suggesting this idea.

Update unit selection UX to highlight common and recently-used units and make it easier to find and select units|"**Problem Statement**Unit converters in Calculator support a large set of units, which can make it difficult to quickly access common or frequently-used units.**Evidence or User Insights**There is some discussion in #382 regarding having a smaller set of units by default with an option to turn on more in settings. Numerous issues (#108, #167, #271, #325, #275, #515) discuss expanding the set of units or converters further, which improves converters overall, but makes this particular UX problem worse.Anecdotally, it is clear to see some scenarios where we show common units mixed in with uncommon units:![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1414423/61423332-3bb0a700-a8c4-11e9-81ee-ac30b959e6c5.png)**Proposal**Update the unit selection UX to highlight common and recently-used units and make it easier to find and select units.**Goals*** Users can quickly select commonly-used units* Users can quickly select recently-used units* Users can easily find less commonly-used units**Non-Goals*** Determining which converters/units to include is out-of-scope (covered by #515)* Redesign any other parts of converter navigation or UX**Low-Fidelity Concept**One approach might be an AutoSuggestBox/ComboBox hybrid experience.

Add Matrix & Vector Modes|"**Problem Statement**Matrix and Vector math can be complicated and hard, but is a vital thing to understand in college-level math for [various fields of study](https://www.decodedscience.org/practical-uses-matrix-mathematics/40494), especially [computer graphics](http://news.mit.edu/2013/explained-matrices-1206) and [artificial intelligence](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-mathematics-of-machine-learning-894f046c568). Having a calculator to help with basic calculations can help users focus on the results and understanding than tedium after initial skills have been learned in class.  By making matrices/vector math more discoverable and easier to process, we can make the skills required for these advanced fields more approachable.**Evidence or User Insights**There are [many](https://www.symbolab.com/solver/matrix-calculator) [online](https://matrixcalc.org/en/) [matrix](https://matrix.reshish.com/multiplication.php) [calculators](https://www.emathhelp.net/calculators/linear-algebra/matrix-calculator/) available.

How will it meet the target audience’s needs? If there are business goals or metrics, how does this improve them?-->I think these modes are combined as matrix math can lead to a vector which then may want to be manipulated.  They could also have similar interfaces to be shared, so it could make sense for them to overlap.  The keyboard should be contextual anyway and only highlight/enable operations that make sense for the current state of the calculator.This mode should allow a user to visually set the vector/matrix/matrices size(s) and click with in each cell to enter values (or use number keys and return to enter a value and then proceed to next empty cell or arrow keys to navigate cells).  They should be able to see a single matrix or two matrices to perform operations involving 1 or 2 matrices.After performing an operation, the matrix display should update to show the resulting matrix/value.  The user should be able to click within their history to also restore the original matrices states from before the operation (i.e. to go back a step and re-perform a different operation).**Goals**<!--What you want to accomplish with this feature.

Converter should integrate (or reuse) online unit conversions (Bing or similar services) to increase category/unit coverage|"<!--See https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator/blob/master/docs/NewFeatureProcess.md for suggestions on how to write a good feature pitch. Just want to submit an idea quickly? Try Feedback Hub instead: https://insider.windows.com/en-us/fb/?contextid=130-->**Problem Statement**The proposed feature is to add more comprehensive coverage of categories and units for Converter through some form of integration with newly created or existing online systems.Calculator provides unit conversions for 13 categories (Currency, Volume, Length, Weight/Mass, Temperature, Energy, Area, Speed, Time, Power, Data, Pressure, Angle) via the main Hamburger Menu. Length has for example selections for 11 units (Nanometer, Microns, Millimeters, Centimeters, Meters, Kilometers, Inches, Feed, Yards, Miles, Nautical Miles) and outputs additional 'practical' units in the UI (Paperclips). While the current hard-coded list of conversions in calculator is reasonably extensive, the fixed set of units can quickly reach its limits, in particular when scientific or rare units are required (see evidence below). Once a user hits a unit conversion limitation, they will likely turn to search engines which generally provide the requested conversions directly from the search box. This slows down the user trying to perform unit conversions (context switch to browser, copy-and-paste of converted results) overall diminishes the value of the unit conversion feature and Calculator in a cloud-connected world.The goal for this feature is to make the Converter the one-stop-shop for unit conversions, in particular for scientific and educational settings.<!--What problem are we trying to solve?

How will it meet the target audience’s needs? If there are business goals or metrics, how does this improve them?-->The related work to modernize the unit conversion architecture:https://github.com/microsoft/calculator/issues/379should consider making Converter fully data driven, and integrate with an online data-source or service so Converter can provide more comprehensive (and daily updatable) conversion tables without binary updates to Calculator itself.Assuming the existence of an online service which would aggregate and serve existing conversions from online sources (i.e. via an exposed search engine API or code-sharing), add currency services, scrape Wikipedia or other public sources, and allow for curation (to avoid errors), Converter could download and cache a conversion table that is much more comprehensive than the current version.**Goals**<!--What you want to accomplish with this feature. Typical examples include'User Can *perform some task*'-->User can convert anything that works in a search engine such as '20 dollars into euro' or '1 ly into mm' with Converter.**Non-Goals**<!--Things we are explicitly not doing or supporting or that are out of scope, including reasons why.-->Design and implementation of the web-service that aggregates and serves conversion data.**Low-Fidelity Concept**<!--Show as much of the experience as needed to explain the idea.

Using the up-arrow to select items in the conversion list only works when down-arrow not used and list is scrolled|"<!--Before filing a bug- Ensure the bug reproduces on the latest version of the app.- Search existing issues and make sure this issue is not already filed.-->**Describe the bug**<!--A clear and concise description of what the bug is.-->This is a complicated visual bug. When the Conversions hamburger menu is open, scrolling to the bottom and using the up arrow, the list will scroll but will not select items. When it gets to the stop, 'Standard' will be cut off and the hamburger icon will be selected. Using the down arrow and up arrows will allow any item in the list to be selected. When closing the menu and going back into it, the items select as normal most of the time.**Steps To Reproduce**<!--Steps to reproduce the behavior:1. Go to '...'2. Click on '....'3. Scroll down to '....'4. See error-->1. Open Calculator2. Open the hamburger menu, don't click on any items, and scroll to the bottom4. Close the hamburger menu5. Re-open the hamburger menu6. Click on 'Standard'7. Re-open the hamburger menu, scroll to the bottom8. Place your cursor over the last menu item (sometimes this works)9. Press the up arrow key many times. Sometimes, it will do nothing, sometimes it will scroll the list but will not select any items.10. I have attached a screenshot of what happens when you get to the top.11. When the hamburger item is selected, pressing the down arrow will select Standard. This appears to be the only way to select standard when in this state (Standard will not be automatically selected on first-try).**Expected behavior**<!--A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.-->The arrow keys always select an item, and will not scroll the list without selecting an item. Also, the 'Standard' text at the top will not be clipped. The standard item will be selected rather than being clipped, as the hamburger menu is selected.**Screenshots**<!--If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.-->![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7844441/55496894-71cc6280-5616-11e9-9346-2c6315de76f6.png)**Device and Application Information (please complete the following information):**- OS Build: 10.0.17763.0- Architecture: X64- Application Version: 10.1902.42.0<!--Run the following commands in Powershell and copy/paste the output.' - OS Build: $([Environment]::OSVersion.Version)'' - Architecture: $((Get-AppxPackage -Name Microsoft.WindowsCalculator).Architecture)'' - Application Version: $((Get-AppxPackage -Name Microsoft.WindowsCalculator).Version)'-->**Additional context**<!--Add any other context about the problem here.-->Hovering over the scroll bar while the hamburger menu item is selected, then hover over standard, then pressing down causes the about button to be selected.

Add 'Running' conversions category|"**Problem Statement**Distance running is a constant interplay between space, time, and pain. Eavesdrop into any discussion between runners, and you’ll be constantly hearing about paces, race times, interval splits, and hitting the wall. Athletes and coaches need to convert between different speed, pace, and race time measures when they are planning their training or races. These conversions are mentally difficult to perform, and even to think of an algorithm for, if the runner is not mathematically inclined.**Evidence or User Insights**A [web search](https://www.bing.com/search?q=running+pace+conversion) can get us a lot of charts and online calculators that try to address this problem, but they usually provide conversions for a small set of data points, and only for a few measurements (usually between minutes per mile and minutes per kilometer paces).Yet, distance running is an extremely popular sport, and very available to everyone. In 2018, more than 18 million people registered for road races just in the USA ([reference](https://runningusa.org/RUSA/News/2019/Running_USA_Releases_2019_U.S._Running_Trends_Report.aspx)). Helping this broad user base around the world easily solve their conversion problems would bring them one step closer to achieving their goals.**Proposal**We propose to introduce a new conversion mode into Windows Calculator that would make these conversions easy for everyone interested in or practicing running.A typical list of measures would include:* Speed: Miles per hour* Speed: Kilometers per hour* Pace: Minutes per mile* Pace: Minutes per kilometer* Race time: 5K* Race time: 10K* Race time: Half marathon* Race time: Marathon* Intervals: 200m time* Intervals: 400m time* Intervals: 600m time* Intervals: 800m time**Goals**With this mode, a user would be able to solve real world problems such as:* What pace do I need to run to achieve my goal 42:00 time in a 10K race?* My training plan shows paces in minutes per kilometer, but I am using minutes per mile, how can I change them using Windows Calculator?* What speed do I set the treadmill to for my interval workout? The plan specifies paces.* What’s the target pace for 1’15” 400m intervals?* If I could run as fast as Eliud Kipchoge when he achieved his latest Marathon world record, what would my 5K time be? (The right answer is “you probably can’t” but the calculator would show 14:24. Wow. I can't *think* that fast, let alone run.)**Non-Goals**Calculating race times and paces for non-standard race distances, including ultras.**Low-Fidelity Concept**![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29615544/55478410-5a947180-5624-11e9-87cc-3113a460bf5f.png)"|open|419|undefined|[{"id":1243469398,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQzNDY5Mzk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/calculator/labels/Enhancement","name":"Enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1211612173,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjExNjEyMTcz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/calculator/labels/help%20wanted","name":"help wanted","color":"008672","default":true,"description":"Issues identified as good community contribution opportunities"},{"id":1376241572,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzc2MjQxNTcy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/calculator/labels/needs%20spec","name":"needs spec","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":""}]|null

Investigation of Linux builds|"With #212 now merged and #211 in the works, it should be possible to build parts of calculator on Linux/macOS with GCC and Clang. To avoid losing that ability, a CI job should verify PRs with those compilers, just like it's already being done with MSVC on Windows.I have spent some time looking into that and would like to discuss how should this be addressed.The project is using C++17 and will need GCC at least version 7. Looking at what Azure offers, I can see either a hosted Ubuntu 16.04 or the same, but with containers. Ubuntu 16.04 ships with GCC 5, which won't be enough and while it's possible to install updated compiler, it's more maintenance than anyone wants and if I recall correctly, it's a rather long process (I have only done so on Travis-CI, not on Azure, YMMV). This leaves the containers option, but most official vanilla containers (https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu, https://hub.docker.com/_/gcc) ship without `sudo` and Azure runs them as non-root, making installing packages impossible, see https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-pipelines-agent/issues/2043. That leaves an option of using community-built images, such as https://hub.docker.com/r/rikorose/gcc-cmake.Is using such community-built images a viable option for this repository? Perhaps you would like to clone the images and use your own version? Is Azure the way to go? In other project using C++17 we prepare our own Docker images via Docker Hub and execute them on Travis-CI.Ubuntu 18.04 would suffice, but it is not available through Azure, see https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-pipelines-image-generation/issues/506.  https://hub.docker.com/search/?q=&type=image&image_filter=official&operating_system=linux&category=os has images for other distros, but they all run into the same problems as outlined above.While this mostly discussed GCC, Clang would face similar issues using Linux images."|open|395|mcooley|[{"id":1289130176,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg5MTMwMTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/calculator/labels/build","name":"build","color":"90edd6","default":false,"description":"Any work that primarily impacts the solution / project files, but not the code itself."},{"id":1449049743,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDQ5MDQ5NzQz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/calculator/labels/needs%20attention","name":"needs attention","color":"e99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1265601545,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjY1NjAxNTQ1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/calculator/labels/tooling","name":"tooling","color":"001b7c","default":false,"description":"Work that primarily impacts the yaml or administration of the GitHub project itself."}]|null

Proposal to modernize the architecture of Unit Conversions|"# Problem StatementThere are two flaws with the way the calculator currently manages unit conversions: - it doesn't allow us to support some new scenarios (including some already identified by the community), restricting the possibilities and innovations.- It's obvious, the current code has a long history and some technical choices from the past don’t make sense anymore, making the code inefficient and challenging to understand/modify.Here is a proposal to improve how the calculator manages unit conversions, and for clearing the path for new features going forward.This proposal is a work-in-progress, some of the changes will lead to a big refactoring of a part of the application. Before even starting to modify how unit conversion works, let's list all the future needs we will have, to be sure to suit all of them and let's debate about the different actions in comments. Don't hesitate to share your ideas and feedback, this document will be regularly updated to take into account your suggestions.# GoalThis proposal is a work-in-progress, some of the changes will lead to a big refactoring of a part of the application. Before even starting to modify how unit conversion works, let's debate and list all the future needs we will have to be sure to suit all of them and let's debate about the different actions in comments. Don't hesitate to share your ideas and feedback, this document will be regularly updated to take into account your suggestions.# Proposal## Step 1: Simplify Data Loader + merge Unit and UnitData.When the user opens one of the converters, `UnitConverterViewModel` creates a `UnitConverter` object, hosting 2 Data loaders: `UnitConverterDataLoader` and `CurrencyConverterDataLoader`. To simplify our analysis, we can ignore the second data loader, but there are still many issues from the first data loader.The `UnitConverterDataLoader` hosts 2 main objects: - A `map<CategoryId, vector<Unit>>`:  - `Unit` objects containing:    - Unit Id    - Name (string)    - Abbreviation (string)    - (+ an order via `OrderedUnit`)- A list of `UnitData`:  - `UnitData` objects containing:    - Category Id    - Unit Id    - A Factor (double) representing the value of the unit measured in an unspecified base unit used by all UnitData from the same category.Even if these 2 collections are static and hosted by the same class, they have data redundancy, with the association Category↔Unit being defined by the `map<CategoryId, Unit>` but also by the `UnitData`.The only valuable information hosted by `UnitData` is `Factor` and we have no reason to prevent us from merging `Unit` and `UnitData` and creating a single object containing all the necessary information to fully describe a unit:| Unit                  ||-----------------------|| Unit Id               || Name (string)         || Abbreviation (string) |## Step 2a: Get rid of the ratio matrixWhen the users open one of the unit converters, `UnitConverterDataLoader` will, for each category, create a 2D table of all unit combinations from the same category (including pairs of the same unit but also ratio per pairs A->B, B->A) and will calculate the ratio between the 2 units.For unit conversations, 2996 ratios will be calculated (including 1369 for the category Data) and stored. When the currency converter is opened or when the user refreshes the currency rates, the application calculates and stores 16,384 ratios, while the user will probably use only 1 or 2 of them. A ratio is stored by a struct `ConversionData`, containing 2 doubles and boolean, so a total of 17 bytes for 1 ratio (without counting the overhead of the vector and the map), or 23KB for units and 278KB for currencies!Now that the calculator is open-sourced, new units will be added, increasing the number of ratios in a category by (Number of units+1)*2 -1)._(very simplified (and not UML compliant) diagram of the current architecture)_![image_preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1226538/54942873-426a7700-4eed-11e9-8424-591085cd9969.png)Contrary to `UnitConverterDataLoader`, values of `CurrencyConverterDataLoader` can be refreshed by the users, again creating a full matrices of 16K objects each time the user clicks on the *update rate* button.Based on the high number of calculations (and memory) necessary to build this matrix, this “optimization” doesn't seem to be one, especially when the conversion from one unit to another is a simple multiplication followed by a division (+ 2 additions if Offset is used), so all these efforts don’t seem to necessary. Getting rid of these caches will have a direct impact on performance and memory usage.## Step 2b: UnitConverter shouldn’t clone data from the 2 data loaders.Even if `UnitConverter` has access to data from `UnitConverterDataLoader` and `CurrencyConverterDataLoader`, `UnitConverter` will create and host a full copy of the ratio matrix, categories, and list of units in a category from the 2 data loaders, multiplying the space used by 2.Instead, `UnitConverter` should directly use the data from the data loaders and act as a Facade between the ViewModel and the DataLoaders, saving a lot of space and not forcing a useless sync of caches when users refresh currency rates.## Step 3: Units conversions should manage non-linear unit conversionsThe application currently only supports linear conversions (ax + b), making it difficult to support some new units.Some examples of non-linear units:- Sound power: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_power#Sound_power_level- Sound pressure: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_pressureWe already face this issue with Temperature (Celsius, Fahrenheit, …) forcing us to make some exceptions in the application with custom codes. The following ticket https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator/issues/347 asks for the support of interval of temperatures, instead of adding more exceptions, we should redesign how the unit conversation between units work.Instead of using 2 doubles: factor and offset, we should use a pivot unit for each category (already the case, but we must explicitly name the unit used) and add 2 functions to `Unit` to convert values from and to this pivot unit.| Unit                                          ||-----------------------------------------------|| int Id                                        || string Name                                   || string Abbreviation                           || double FromPivotUnit(double valueInPivotUnit) || double ToPivotUnit(double value)              |The conversion from one unit to another will be possible via the following code: `ToUnit→FromPivotUnit(FromUnit→ToPivotUnit(fromValue))`Some examples: ### Length (pivot unit: millimeter) - linear conversion**Centimeter**- double FromPivotUnit(double valueInPivotUnit){ return valueInPivotUnit / 10;} - double ToPivotUnit(double value){return valueInPivotUnit * 10;}**Meter**- double FromPivotUnit(double valueInPivotUnit){ return valueInPivotUnit / 1000;} - double ToPivotUnit(double value){return value* 1000;}### Temperature (pivot unit: Celsius) - non-linear conversion**Celsius**- double FromPivotUnit(double valueInPivotUnit){ return valueInPivotUnit;} - double ToPivotUnit(double value){return value;}**Fahrenheit**- double FromPivotUnit(double valueInPivotUnit){ return valueInPivotUnit × 9/5 + 32;} - double ToPivotUnit(double value){return (value - 32) * 5 / 9;}To simplify the code (and because 99% of units will simply use a factor), we can provide a class `UnitUsingFactor`, inheriting from Unit and implementing `FromPivotUnit` and `ToPivotUnit`.This solution will allow us to support all types of units without excessive effort and restrictions.## Step 4: Add support of multi-part unitsThe application currently only supports units with a single number. The 2 tickets #243 and #57  require the application to support units with sub-parts. While the pivot unit can still be a double, values should be represented with a double[]:| Unit                                             ||--------------------------------------------------|| int Id                                           || string UnitName                                  || int NumberOfParts                                || string[] PartNames                               || string[] PartAbbreviations                       || double[] FromPivotUnit(double valueInPivotUnit); || double ToPivotUnit(double[]);                    |Example for Feet+Inches in the category Length (pivot unit: millimeters)| Unit                                             |                                                                     ||--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|| int Id                                           |                                                                     || string UnitName                                  | “Feet+Inches”                                                       || int NumberOfParts                                | 2                                                                   || string[] PartNames                               | [“Feet”, “Inches”]                                                  || string[] PartAbbreviations                       | [“′”, “\””]                                                         || double[] FromPivotUnit(double valueInPivotUnit); | return [(int)valueInPivotUnit/304.8, (valueInPivotUnit%304.8)/25.4] || double ToPivotUnit(double[]);                    | return value[0]*304.8 + value[1]*25.4                               |The UI will also need to be modified in order to support the display (and the editing) of units with subparts.## ConclusionOnce these changes are complete, the application will be more efficient and will allow opportunities for new scenarios that are currently not possible, but first, let's work all together on the new architecture.Don't hesitate to give your feedback and debate, this post will be regularly updated to take feedback into account."|open|379|undefined|[{"id":1355573903,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzU1NTczOTAz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/calculator/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"bfe5bf","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1273734578,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNzM0NTc4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/calculator/labels/codebase%20quality","name":"codebase quality","color":"E6B33D","default":false,"description":"Issues that are not bugs, but still might be worth improving (eg, code hygiene or maintainability)"}]|null
Show next set of access key shortcuts immediately|"When a menu is opened with the keyboard, the choices for the next menu keys should be shown immediately. For example, when you press Alt+H, you should see the choices for next keys you can press. Currently, you don't see anything.There is a workaround. If you press Alt+H and then press Alt again, you see the next key choices. The extra key press shouldn't be necessary. If the user presses Alt+H, he's going to want to press another key to do something next. Immediately showing the next menu choices goes way back. It's in the Office Ribbon, It's in the standard Windows pull-down menu. It was in pull-down menus in DOS apps like Quick Basic in the 1980s.

Failure to make this available will have our poor American colleagues misunderstanding that we are not talking about limiting global temperature rise to 39.2 degrees Fahrenheit!**Proposal**Either:a) Where there is currently a single option for 'Temperature' in the hamburger, have two: Temperature (Interval) or Temperature (Scale).b) Keep the single option for 'Temperature' in the hamburger, then have a separate radio button along the lines of 'Interval (referring to the difference between two temperatures)' and 'Scale (referring to what temperature an object is)'My preference would be b).**Goals**Stop people incorrectly converting units when they are talking about a temperature interval.**Non-Goals**We are not submitting a bug to upstream governments to ban the use of Celsius and Fahrenheit.

Add Graphing Mode|"> This feature is in pre-production. Contribute to the in-progress spec **[here](https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator-specs/tree/graphingmode/active/GraphingMode)**.**Problem Statement**High school algebra is the gateway to mathematics and all other disciplines of STEM. However, algebra is the single most failed course in high school, as well as the most failed course in community college ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/09/15/of-course-algebra-is-important-its-also-a-huge-problem/)). Graphing capabilities in their daily tools are essential for students who are beginning to explore linear algebra as early as 8th grade. Physical graphing calculators can be expensive, software solutions require licenses and configuration by school IT departments, and online solutions are not always an option. At present, Windows Calculator does not currently have the needed functionality to meet the demands of students.**Evidence or User Insights**Graphing calculator provides an accessible and engaging method for students and teachers to learn and teach. Research has shown that graphing calculators foster conceptual understanding of developmental math students (Hopkins & Amelia, 1998; Laughbaum, 2002, 2003; Shore & Shore, 2003) by:* Increased speed * Opportunity to study rich mathematics through technology* Make connections through different data representations* Deeper understanding on “why”Graphing Calculator is also the top requested feature in [Feedback Hub](https://aka.ms/AA43wie).**Proposal**Empower students to learn mathematics by improving conceptual understanding and attitudes towards math by adding graphing support to Windows Calculator targeting grades 8-12 students and teachers (math/physics). With graphing calculator, we can improve learning outcomes of students by increasing engagement and visualization of math equations.**Goals*** Provide a great baseline graphing calculator experience in Windows Calculator* Support all [US common core math curriculum](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/), including:  * Ability to build and interpret functions  * Understand linear, quadratic, and exponential models  * Trigonometric functions  * Reason with equations and inequalities**Non-Goals*** Support advanced calculus or statistics functionality* Parity with more advanced graphing solutions **User Cans*** Users can enter an equation so that it can be viewed on the graph.* Users can enter multiple equations so that they can compare plots against each other and see the interactions between the lines.* Users can edit equations so that they can see how changes affect the plot and correct mistakes.* Users can change the graph viewing window so that they can see different parts of the plot at different levels of detail.* Users can change line visual options so that they can clearly differentiate between multiple plots.* Users can export graphs so that they can share it with others or incorporate into Office/Teams.* Users can easily manipulate secondary variables in equations so that they can quickly understand how changes to equations affect the graph. * Users can see traceable key graph features (KGF) as nodes/dots on the equations, and summon other KGFs in a list so that they can better understand the important features of a given function.* Users can trace plots so that they can better understand the relationship between variables in the equation on the graph.**Low-Fidelity Concept**![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1414423/54637871-e3b58100-4a46-11e9-9a2b-2c46b4972cb8.png)"|open|338|grochocki|[{"id":1243469398,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQzNDY5Mzk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/calculator/labels/Enhancement","name":"Enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1243554125,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQzNTU0MTI1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/calculator/labels/Pri:%201","name":"Pri: 1","color":"EEEEEE","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1243553616,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQzNTUzNjE2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/calculator/labels/Swag:%20XL%20(1+%20months)","name":"Swag: XL (1+ months)","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1376241572,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzc2MjQxNTcy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/calculator/labels/needs%20spec","name":"needs spec","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":""}]|null

Include formula for all conversions|"**Problem Statement**<!-- What problem are we trying to solve? Who’s the target audience? Is there a customer need orpain point we need to remedy? Is there a business goal or metric we are trying to improve? Do wehave a hypothesis we want to prove or disprove? -->The problem statement is that I'm performing conversion between 2 units, for example **8 ml to ounces**. I open up the volume converter, select the desired units and enter 8. I get the output in ounces but now I look at the two numbers and find myself wondering what is the formula to get oz from ml. So I need to edit my input to 1 and try and figure out a relation between these two. May check inputs and outputs for 1, 10, 100 and notice that they are related by a certain factor.While most conversions might have a relationship based on multiplying or dividing a certain factor, this may not be true for all conversions. For example Celsius to Fahrenhiet or similar.

Bring back insert-from-history|"**Problem Statement**Easily insert result(s) from the history **into** an expression being composed, by simply clicking them.Compared to typing out one single big expression using parenthesis, this proposal lets the user: * verify that results of sub-expressions look correct (in the history) * avoid duplication, for example in a ratio `A / (A + B)` , where `A` and `B` are the results of non-trivial expressions**Evidence or User Insights**Currently it is awkward and error-prone to reuse a results from history, and impossible(?) to combine results.  This is a regression from the Win32 calculator, and differs from other software calculators with history (e.g. Android).To illustrate, people familiar with other apps are likely to first wipe what they've written by clicking the history item. Being familiar with physical calculators they might next try something like: 1. Click history item 2. M+ 3. Start retyping the wiped expressionHuh, step 3 partially modified the _history_ expression, weird.  So before step 3 we needed to press ESC, fine. Start over. Oh no! There was now a value in memory and M+ doubled it. Right I should have used MS (but then, I have never owned a physical calculator with a MS button.) OK then: click MC (did I need to do that?) Press ESC. Start over again... Even once the confusion is resolved, the process still takes a minimum of 3 steps, using 3 UI elements (the history item, MS, MR) where a single click could suffice. And it only works for one value.Note that _some_ scenarios are possible via Ctrl+C, but:  * to Ctrl+C something from history wipes what you've typed - you still cannot combine history items * the UWP look does not make it obvious that Copy & Paste is available**Proposal**If an item is in the history (`10*20 = 200`) and a new expression is being typed... * ending in an operator (`1 / `): clicking a history item should **append** the result (yielding: `1 / 200`) * ending in an value (`1 / 5`): the final value should be replaced (`1 / 200`). This is for consistency with other buttons (like MR).To **overwrite** the current expression, it should still be obvious and intuitive that you can click `C` or press ESC before clicking a history item - making both operations easily accessible.**Goals**To make the history pane more useful, via easy reuse of prior results.**Non-Goals**Inserting the __entire expression__ from history into the current expression. (That would require a movable text cursor in the main expression editor, which is probably quite a UI departure.)**Low-Fidelity Concept**Constructing a 3rd expression from 2 prior expressions (by clicking them) in the Windows 7 Calculator: ![win7_calc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2722420/54205667-0e4b8b00-44d7-11e9-9052-1fa1e1988777.png)**Related** * Editing expressions in the history list: #163"|open|277|undefined|[{"id":1243469398,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQzNDY5Mzk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/calculator/labels/Enhancement","name":"Enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1355573903,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzU1NTczOTAz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/calculator/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"bfe5bf","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1211612173,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjExNjEyMTcz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/calculator/labels/help%20wanted","name":"help wanted","color":"008672","default":true,"description":"Issues identified as good community contribution opportunities"}]|null
Converter doesn't automatically flip from & to fields during conversion|"**Describe the bug**Converter doesn't easily flip the from & to fields during conversions (Temperature, Volume, Speed etc.)**Steps To Reproduce**Steps to reproduce the behavior:1. Launch Calculator2. Click on Menu and open the Temperature Converter3. It loads Celsius to Fahrenheit4. Try to flip the conversion5. Change first field from Celsius to Fahrenheit6. Change second field from Fahrenheit to Celsius**Expected behavior**It would be nice if the converter could automatically flip the from & to values during conversion. If a Celsius-> Fahrenheit conversion is changed to Fahrenheit -> Fahrenheit conversion then it should be modify it to Fahrenheit -> Celsius similar to how most of these converters work online. In the above steps if the user shouldn't have to perform step #6.**Screenshots**<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6065982/54163204-7fc30500-4415-11e9-8292-8d31e15e7872.gif' width='300'><!--![calculator](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6065982/54163204-7fc30500-4415-11e9-8292-8d31e15e7872.gif | width=100)-->**Device and Application Information (please complete the following information):** - OS Build: 10.0.17763.0 - Architecture: X64 - Application Version: 10.1812.10048.0**Additional context**Might also be good to add a flip or exchange button to directly flip the to & from fields."|open|266|undefined|[{"id":1243469398,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQzNDY5Mzk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/calculator/labels/Enhancement","name":"Enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1355573903,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzU1NTczOTAz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/calculator/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"bfe5bf","default":false,"description":""}]|null
